- Practicals 
    - Week 1 - Information Exercises
    - Week 2 - Randomness Exercises
    - Week 3 - Bias Exercises
    - Week 4 - Outliers Exercises
    - Week 5 - Data Cleansing Exercises
- Normal Distribution Assignment

## How to use these
1. Make sure that Python including Jupyter is installed on your machine (you can easily download Python via Anaconda from the internet).
2. Go to my Github repository: https://github.com/Anna20041983/funddata-assesment
3. Click the download button to save a copy of the repository on your machine.
4. In CMDER or any other command line type 'Jupyter Notebook' and click enter.
5. Once the Jupyter Notebook is opened in your default browser, go to each individual file (from Week 1 to Week 5 in Practicals Folder and Normal Distribution Notebook)
6. In each individual Jupyter Notebook click on 'Kernel', then 'Restart & Run All' to run codes and generate graphs
